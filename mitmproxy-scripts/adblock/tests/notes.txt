test results:
=============

1. https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/adblock.html
   * direct HTTPS connection:
     - blocked:  20 of 147 = 13.6%
     - allowed: 127 of 147 = 86.4%
   * with 'adblock' mitmproxy script:
     - blocked: 143 of 147 = 97.3%
     - allowed:   4 of 147 =  2.7%
     - blocklists:
       1. https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt
          - size: 1.37 MB
     - notes:
       * network is slightly (but noticably) slower with 'adblock' running
       * blocklists will automatically update when older than 7 days,
         when 'adblock' script is initialized,
         which occurs when 'PCAPdroid-mitm' is started
     - issues:
       * When an automatic blocklists update is triggered,
         the files download very quickly,
         but there must be a race-condition of some sort,
         because the 'adblock' hangs,
         and prevents 'PCAPdroid-mitm' from working properly.
         When this occurs,
         after the blocklists have finished download,
         if 'PCAPdroid-mitm' is stopped and restarted,
         everything works as it should.

==============
extensibility:
==============

1. file: 'adblock.py'
   * method:   'update_blocklists'
   * variable: 'default_blocklist_urls'
   * purpose:
     - defines an array of URLs for blocklists that should be managed by the script
     - every 7 days, these URLs are redownloaded and saved to:
       * directory: 'adblock/output/blocklists'
       * filenames: "${array_index}.txt"

2. directory: 'adblock/output/blocklists'
   * purpose:
     - a user can save additional blocklist text files into this directory
     - so long as filenames don't collide with those managed by the script,
       user blocklists will:
       * never be deleted
       * always be used
