usage:
======
* in directory: 'modify_html_files/input'
  - each "rule" consists of a pair of two files:
    1. "${unique-name}.json"
    2. "${unique-name}.txt"
  - where:
    * the JSON file defines an object:
      - required attributes:
        * regex_url
      - exactly one of the following attributes is required:
        * regex_insert_before
        * regex_insert_after
        * regex_insert_between
      - where:
        * regex_url
          - must match the requested URL
        * regex_insert_before
          - must be found in the HTML content
          - capture groups are ignored
        * regex_insert_after
          - must be found in the HTML content
          - capture groups are ignored
        * regex_insert_between
          - must be found in the HTML content
          - the regex pattern must include two capture groups;
            unless doing something very advanced,
            the entire pattern will typically be divided between these two groups
    * the TEXT file contains HTML content:
      - which is injected into the HTML response,
        conditional on: 'regex_url' match
        at a position determined by: 'regex_insert_xxx' match
